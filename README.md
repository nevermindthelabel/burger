# Burger

## Goal

In this assignment, our goal was to create our own [orm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for sever side scripting, [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) for our server, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to listen for click events and control our ajax requests, [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for our database, and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to build semantic templates. Some basic styling is used on the page with CSS and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

### The project is deployed live on [heroku](https://intense-badlands-37116.herokuapp.com/)

The challenge was to create a basic database with a few burgers in it, and have that display on our page with the help of handlebars. There are forms for a user to enter the name of a new burger, then the burger is displayed in the uneaten burgers area, as well as show up in the database as an uneaten burger. There is also a button for each burger available, and when that button is clicked the burger will jump to the eaten side of the page, and the database will also reflect that change thru the magic of ajax requests.
